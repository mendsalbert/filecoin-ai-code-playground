**Grant Proposal: Enhancing Filecoin Documentation with Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guides**

**Project Name:** Comprehensive Developer Guides: Filecoin Storage API Troubleshooting

**Individual or Entity Name:** Albert Mends

**Proposer:** @mendsalbert

**Filecoin ecosystem affiliations:** I have won numerous Filecoin-sponsored hackathons.

### 1. What is your project and what existing gap will your project address?

Our project aims to develop comprehensive troubleshooting guides for common errors encountered when using the Filecoin Storage API. While the current Filecoin documentation is robust, developers often encounter errors with the Storage API that are not well-documented within the official resources. Instead, solutions are found scattered across external sites like StackOverflow and blogs. This project will consolidate these troubleshooting resources into the official Filecoin documentation, providing a more reliable and centralized resource for developers.

### 2. How does your project align with our program focus areas?

This project aligns with the focus area of developing comprehensive developer guides by addressing a specific need: troubleshooting common errors with the Filecoin Storage API. By focusing on error resolution and troubleshooting, the project will enhance the current resources available to developers, improving their ability to integrate and utilize the Filecoin Storage API effectively.

### 3. What are the expected outcomes of the project? What steps will you take to meet this objective?

| Number | Grant Deliverable              | Briefly describe how you will meet deliverable objectives                                           | Timeframe (within 3 months) |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1      | Identify Common Errors         | Research and compile a list of common errors encountered with the Filecoin Storage API.             | 0.5 months                  |
| 2      | Develop Troubleshooting Guides | Create detailed troubleshooting guides for each identified error, providing step-by-step solutions. | 1.5 months                  |
| 3      | Community Feedback             | Engage with the developer community to test and provide feedback on the troubleshooting guides.     | 0.5 months                  |
| 4      | Finalize and Publish           | Refine the guides based on feedback and publish them in the official Filecoin documentation.        | 0.5 months                  |

### 4. How will you determine if your documentation is successfully supporting your intended audience?

Success will be measured by community engagement and feedback. This will include soliciting feedback from developers who use the documentation, monitoring the usage and success rate of the provided solutions, and ensuring that the documentation effectively resolves common issues. User testing sessions with developers who are not part of the creation team will be conducted to validate the documentation's effectiveness.

### 5. Will this work be published under the dual MIT and APACHE2 licenses?

Yes.

### 6. Does your proposal comply with our Community Code of Conduct?

Yes.
